# Udemy Course Subscribers Prediction 

This project builds a regression model to predict the number of subscribers for Finance & Accounting courses on Udemy based on course features like price, rating, content duration, and more.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to forecast demand by predicting subscriber count using course metadata. This helps understand what features influence user interest in online courses.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab
- Linear Regression

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering (label encoding, scaling)
4. Model Training & Evaluation
5. Visualization of Results

## Model Evaluation
- MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score used to evaluate performance
