## Problem Statement
The goal is to forecast demand by predicting subscriber count using course metadata. This helps understand what features influence user interest in online courses.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab
- Linear Regression

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering (label encoding, scaling)
4. Model Training & Evaluation
5. Visualization of Results

## Model Evaluation
- MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score used to evaluate performance
  

## Model Performance

The linear regression model was evaluated using standard regression metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 38,749,594.02  
- **R² Score:** 0.676

These values indicate moderate predictive performance, with potential for improvement through feature engineering, model tuning, or alternative algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
